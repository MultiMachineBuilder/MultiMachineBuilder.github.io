1. Download and install Eclipse with JDT
2. Import the 'MultiMachineBuilder' project in Eclipse
3. Enter `https://github.com/MultiMachineBuilder/MultiMachineBuilder` as the URI
4. Create a Personal Access Token for your account with only full repository access.

Store the credentials in Secure Store, because PAT won't appear ever again
